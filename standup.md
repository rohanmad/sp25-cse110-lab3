# Daily Standup Meeting Template

### What I accomplished yesterday
1. Finished the card dealing algorithm
2. Added a shuffling algorithm for the deck of cards
3. Added a mechanism that allows for the deck's state to stay even after a page refresh
   

### What I will do today
1. Attempt to create and finish a Blackjack game, implementing the card deck I built yesterday
2. Work with other teams to establish clear lines about styling, HTML, and JS dependencies.


### Potential Issues 
1. HTML team hasn't been on top of their work, they are behind based on my JS code. 
2. Confront the HTML team about their work and how they need to get on top of it. 


### Tasks Needed to be Implemented
1. Deploy the webpage so users can access it. 
2. Polish the Blackjack game, test for edge cases, specifically when dealed an Ace.
